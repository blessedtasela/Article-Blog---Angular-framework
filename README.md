# Article-Blog---Angular-framework #
*** My first Angular web application ***

This is a simple web application that i built using angular framework

It bootstraps the `<app-root>` tag and there is another component i added 

So, this app is based on displaying articles in order of their point number

Articles with higher points appear at the top of the screen. This is done using 
a built in sort algorithm function of typescrit

User (basically one user as there is no authentifiction required and no user component)
can either downvote or upvote an article. So it increases or decreases by one point

User can also add new article to the list of articles. Title, and link to the article

Added articles via the form isn't stored in local storage or any db, so when refreahed,
data would be lost

I created 3 testing objects that is stored in the code

Thank you for reading through, my angular journey continues. More improvements to come!
